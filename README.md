# **Bin2Dec Converter**

Binary is the **fundamental number system** that underpins all digital computers, making it essential for developers to grasp its concepts. The **Bin2Dec Converter** is a simple tool designed to help users practice and understand binary mathematics. It allows users to input strings of up to 8 binary digits (0s and 1s) in any order and then instantly displays the equivalent decimal (base 10) value.

## **Key Features**

- Input up to 8 binary digits.
- Real-time validation to notify the user if anything other than 0 or 1 is entered.
- Accurate conversion of binary to decimal using a single mathematical function, optimizing efficiency.

## **Constraints**

- No use of arrays to store binary digits.
- Calculation of decimal equivalents of binary digits must rely on a single mathematical function (e.g., natural logarithm).

## **How to Use**

1. Enter a binary number consisting of up to 8 digits (0s and 1s) into the input field.
2. The converter will instantly calculate and display the decimal equivalent in the output field.
3. If any invalid characters are detected in the input, you will be notified.

Developed with simplicity and efficiency in mind, the **Bin2Dec Converter** is a valuable tool for developers looking to strengthen their understanding of binary mathematics. Enhance your binary skills and effortlessly convert binary to decimal with this easy-to-use utility.
